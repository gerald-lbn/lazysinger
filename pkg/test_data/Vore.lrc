[00:15.27] You have become the voice in my head
[00:21.76] Only recourse we're left after death
[00:27.06] Your viscera welcome me in
[00:33.52] Welcome me in
[00:40.44] My life is torn, my bones, they bleed
[00:46.42] My metaphors fall short in the end
[00:52.57] Your flesh and bone welcome me in
[00:59.21] Welcome me in
[01:08.76] Are you in pain like I am?
[01:15.95]
[01:40.88] Will we remain stuck in the throat of gods?
[01:53.73] Will the pain stop if we go deeper?
[02:10.69] So let's get swallowed whole
[02:19.85] I wanna go where nobody else will
[02:26.06] Ever go
[02:33.61] Walls of flesh, so warm again
[02:38.98] We step into my suffering
[02:46.77] My only need, welcome me in
[02:53.09] Welcome me in
[03:00.71] There is always something in the way
[03:08.80] I wanna have you to myself for once
[03:26.02] Follow me between the jaws of fate
[03:34.29] So I can have you to myself for once
[03:44.44]
[03:51.66] So let's get swallowed whole
[04:01.22] I wanna go where nobody else will
[04:07.33] Ever go
[04:15.95] There is always something in the way
[04:24.40] I wanna have you to myself for once
[04:37.08]
[04:49.12] Are you in pain like I am?
[05:01.54] Are you in pain like I am?
[05:14.60] Are you in pain like I am?
[05:27.04] Are you in pain like I am?
[05:38.72]
