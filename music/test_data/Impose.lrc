[00:11.33] I'm losin' my leverage
[00:14.42] All of the evidence that I'm not just a fraud
[00:23.07] Too deep in my head again
[00:26.39] Won't let nobody in, no matter how hard they knock
[00:35.40] And their echoes sit alone in a prison made of bone
[00:41.31] Oh, I hate it, but it's home for me
[00:47.02] In every place, I'm on my toes, and still I feel like I impose
[00:53.22] It's okay to let me go if you need
[01:00.10] What's it say about me if I run away?
[01:05.59] Without you when I fall asleep, and in your head I'm always gonna stay
[01:12.26] What's it say about me if I never change?
[01:17.46] And I push everyone away on borrowed time, you know I can't repay
[01:25.57]
[01:36.24] Oh, I tried to settle in a life of relevance
[01:42.21] But I long to be lost
[01:48.37] And I tried to sever it, walked to the precipice
[01:54.21] To the sound of applause
[02:00.22] And their echoes sit alone in a prison made of bone
[02:06.24] Oh, I hate it, but it's home for me
[02:12.04] In every place, I'm on my toes, and still I feel like I impose
[02:18.31] It's okay to let me go if you need
[02:23.85] What's it say about me if I run away?
[02:29.08] Without you when I fall asleep, and in your head I'm always gonna stay
[02:35.83] What's it say about me if I never change?
[02:40.97] And I push everyone away on borrowed time, you know I can't repay
[02:49.18]
[02:54.05] And their echoes sit alone in a prison made of bone
[03:01.40]
[03:05.79] In every place, I'm on my toes, and still I feel like I impose
[03:13.92] (I impose)
[03:16.80]
[03:25.26] (I impose)
[03:28.16]
[03:36.57] (I impose)
[03:37.25]
