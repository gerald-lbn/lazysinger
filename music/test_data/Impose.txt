I'm losin' my leverage
All of the evidence that I'm not just a fraud
Too deep in my head again
Won't let nobody in, no matter how hard they knock

And their echoes sit alone in a prison made of bone
Oh, I hate it, but it's home for me
In every place, I'm on my toes, and still I feel like I impose
It's okay to let me go if you need

What's it say about me if I run away?
Without you when I fall asleep, and in your head I'm always gonna stay
What's it say about me if I never change?
And I push everyone away on borrowed time, you know I can't repay

Oh, I tried to settle in a life of relevance
But I long to be lost
And I tried to sever it, walked to the precipice
To the sound of applause

And their echoes sit alone in a prison made of bone
Oh, I hate it, but it's home for me
In every place, I'm on my toes, and still I feel like I impose
It's okay to let me go if you need

What's it say about me if I run away?
Without you when I fall asleep, and in your head I'm always gonna stay
What's it say about me if I never change?
And I push everyone away on borrowed time, you know I can't repay

And their echoes sit alone in a prison made of bone
In every place, I'm on my toes, and still I feel like I impose
(I impose)
(I impose)
(I impose)
